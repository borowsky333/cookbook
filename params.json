{"name":"Cookbook","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Cookbook\r\nCookbook is a social network that lets users post and view recipes.  All of the content in Cookbook is user generated.  Cookbook is a .NET web application powered by Amazon AWS technologies. \r\n\r\n### Why use Cookbook?\r\nThe reason why we need this recipe network is because other recipe websites do not harness the creativity and ingenuity of everyday citizens. Most of these recipe sites use external vendors and popular restaurant chains to populate their databases. In contrast, the content of the project will be entirely user-generated. Users will be able to upload videos and pictures, and have followers. There will be a “newsfeed” aspect, in which the people you follow’s posts will show up. Categories of recipes will be user-generated, via a custom tagging system.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
