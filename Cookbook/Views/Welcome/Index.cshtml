		        <p>Cookbook is a social network that lets users post and view recipes. All of the content in Cookbook is user generated. Cookbook is a .NET web application powered by Amazon AWS technologies.</p>

		        <h4><i class="icon-th-list"></i> Why Need Cookbook?</h4>
		        <p>The reason why we need this recipe network is because other recipe websites do not harness the creativity and ingenuity of everyday citizens. Most recipe sites use external vendors to populate their databases. In contrast, the content of Cookbook is entirely user-generated.</p>
